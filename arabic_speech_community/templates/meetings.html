            <p> The First Arabic speech workshop was held in Doha, April 29<small><sup>th</sup></small> and 30<small><sup>th</sup></small> 2019. The workshop was hosted by Qatar Center for Artificial Intelligence <a href="https://qcai.qcri.org/index.php/2019/04/15/ai-in-speech-what-is-next-for-arabic-speech-recognition-arabicspeech-2019/">(QCAI)</a> of Qatar Computing Research Institute <a href="https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/qcri">(QCRI)</a>.</p>


        <p> The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers, practitioners, students and industry experts in the fields of speech recognition and language processing with special attention to Arabic (standard and dialectal) to present recent advances, to discuss open research questions, and to bridge the gap between research and industry needs on certain concrete problems.</p>
            <p> We invite colleagues from both academic and industrial fields to attend, contribute and discuss these topics with leading experts and practitioners from around the world.</p>

                        <h3>Moroccan Arabic Automatic Speech Recognition</h3>
                        
            <p>The MGB-5 Arabic data comprises <b>14</b> hours of Moroccan Arabic speech extracted from <b>93</b> YouTube videos distributed across seven genres: comedy, cooking, family/children, fashion, drama, sports, and science clips. We assume that the MGB-5 data is not enough by itself to build robust speech recognition systems, but could be useful for adaptation, and for hyper-parameter tuning of models built using the <a 
                                    href="https://arabicspeech.org/mgb2">MGB-2 data.</a> Therefore, we suggest to reuse the MGB-2 training data in this challenge, and consider the provided in-domain data as (supervised) adaptation data.</p>
            <p>Given that dialectal Arabic does not have a clearly defined orthography, different people tend to write the same word in slightly different forms. Therefore, instead of developing strict guidelines to ensure a standardized orthography, variations in spelling are allowed. Thus multiple transcriptions were produced, allowing transcribers to write the transcripts as they deemed correct. Every file has been segmented and transcribed by four different Moroccan annotators.</p> 
            <p>The 93 YouTube clips have been manually labelled for speech, non-speech segments. About 12 minutes from each program were selected for transcription. The resulting speech segments were then distributed into train, development and test data sets as follows:</p>


                         <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                                <li>Training data: <b>10.2</b> hours from <b>69</b> programs</li>
                                <li>Development data: <b>1.8</b> hours from <b>10</b> programs</li>
                <li>Testing data: <b>2.0</b> hours from <b>14</b> programs</li>
                            </ul> 
                        
                        <p>In addition to the transcribed <b>14</b> hours, the full programs are also provided, which amounts <b>48</b> hours for the 93 programs. This data can be used for in-domain speech or genre adaptation.</p>
