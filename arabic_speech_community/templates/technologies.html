                        <br/>
                        <p>Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is defined as the process of realising acoustic speech audio into
                            a corresponding word sequence, which is the word sequence that is as close as possible to what a
                            human could transcribe. The best start for ASR is the <a

                        <p>You can also learn a lot from <a href="http://kaldi-asr.org/">kaldi</a>. Kaldi is a toolkit for
                            speech recognition written in C++ and
                            licensed under the Apache License v2.0. Kaldi is intended for use by speech recognition researchers.

                        <h4 class="">Arabic Dialect Identifcation</h4>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Arabic dialects are sufficiently diverse to the extent that one can argue to describe them as different languages rather than dialects of the same language. Thus, automatically identifying the input dialect can greatly improve ASR.</p>
                        <p>It can be argued that a language is a dialect with an army and navy. If we take this perspective into consideration, we can describe the different Arabic dialects as different languages. However, Arabic today is a language with different dialects and different armies!</p>
                        <p>Dialect identification can be regarded as a special case of language recognition. However, dialect identification is a harder problem since there is no single view of how many spoken dialects there are in Arabic.

                        <br/>
                        <p>The Text to Speech (TTS) technology aims to convert a sequence of words into speech.  Since Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is written without diacritics, the first step to develop an Arabic TTS engine [1] is to restore the diacritics of each word in the text [2][3][4]. The diacritized text is then passed to a phonetic transcription module to generate the phoneme sequence for each phrase [5]. The phone sequence and phonological features are used to synthesis the speech output (i. e. sound).  The synthesizer historically was either concatenative [1] or parametric [6]. Recently, End-to-End synthesizers based on neural networks are developed [7][8][9].</p>
